This study utilizes a mixed-method design based on 30 interviews and a national survey to examine how such ‘relational punishment’ operates in China today as part of the nation-wide Social Credit Blacklist System. The authors first trace the history of blacklisting as a governance tool. The article then illustrates how the state’s symbolic campaign encourages the ostracization of blacklisted people. However, this power has its limits. People commonly differentiate the character of blacklisted people with contextual and relational information, constructing alternative meanings for individuals thus labelled, therefore undermining the reach and influence of the Blacklist System.},

	abstract = {The Chinese Social Credit System ({SCS}) is a novel digital sociotechnical credit system. The {SCS} aims to regulate societal behavior by reputational and material devices. Scholarship on the {SCS} has offered a variety of legal and theoretical perspectives. However, little is known about its actual implementation. Here, we provide the first comprehensive empirical study of digital blacklists (listing “bad” behavior) and redlists (listing “good” behavior) in the Chinese {SCS}. Based on a unique data set of reputational blacklists and redlists in 30 Chinese provincial-level administrative divisions ({ADs}), we show the diversity, flexibility, and comprehensiveness of the {SCS} listing infrastructure. First, our results demonstrate that the Chinese {SCS} unfolds in a highly diversified manner: we find differences in accessibility, interface design and credit information across provincial-level {SCS} blacklists and redlists. Second, {SCS} listings are flexible. During the {COVID}-19 outbreak, we observe a swift addition of blacklists and redlists that helps strengthen the compliance with coronavirus-related norms and regulations. Third, the {SCS} listing infrastructure is comprehensive. Overall, we identify 273 blacklists and 154 redlists across provincial-level {ADs}. Our blacklist and redlist taxonomy highlights that the {SCS} listing infrastructure prioritizes law enforcement and industry regulations. We also identify redlists that reward political and moral behavior. Our study substantiates the enormous scale and diversity of the Chinese {SCS} and puts the debate on its reach and societal impact on firmer ground. Finally, we initiate a discussion on the ethical dimensions of data-driven research on the {SCS}.},

	abstract = {The social credit system is a nationwide reputation system of the People’s Republic of China to evaluate its citizens and enterprises. The goal is to increase the trust in the economy and society through the use of big data technology, artiﬁcial intelligence and public surveillance. Therefore, the government launched a system of Blacklists and Redlists to distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy parties and to sanction or reward natural persons and enterprises. Since the Chinese government plans, to ofﬁcially launch the nationwide system by 2020 [1] in a uniform scheme, the objective of this bachelor’s thesis was to elaborate the progress of the social credit system on the basis of its online appearance. In particular, the differences of Blacklists and Redlists among the four municipalities, ﬁve autonomous regions and 22 provinces of China were framed. For this task, a data-driven analysis approach was conducted. The multiple social credit websites were inspected with regard to the Blacklists and Redlists. Furthermore, a reusable data collection tool was developed to collect Blacklist and Redlist sample entries. With the tool, a dataset of 75677 list entries was created and analyzed. The results showed large variability in the implementation of Blacklists and Redlists, as well as high heterogeneity in depth of information among all 31 administrative divisions.},

Differences in national {CCR} systems pose challenges for multinational companies and have increasingly become a subject of international conflicts on regulatory standards. In this context, the case of China deserves special attention since the country pursues both institutional divergence and convergence with international examples. Hence, the characterization of China's regulatory regime remains difficult. By comparing the institutional context of {CCR} in China to those in the United States and Germany, this paper sheds light on a specific aspect of China's complex regulatory regime. At the same time, it provides insights into the Chinese manifestation of {CCR}, which are important for the international business community.},

This article traces the institutional processes and political-economic interests of the public and private stakeholders involved in the construction of China's Social Credit System ({SCS}), which is currently on track for full deployment on 1.4 billion citizens by 2020. The {SCS} aims to centralize data platforms into a big data–enabled surveillance infrastructure to manage, monitor, and predict the trustworthiness of citizens, firms, organizations, and governments in China. A punishment/reward system based on credit scores will determine whether citizens and organizations are able to access things like education, markets, and tax deductions. While the {SCS} is widely described by the Western news media as a means of “big brother” or political control, we find that it is a complicated system that focuses primarily on financial and commercial activities rather than political ones. This article presents a framework for understanding state surveillance infrastructures by exploring how various government agencies are cooperating to establish this centralized data infrastructure with the aim of scoring credit, and discussing the distinct but interconnected processes of data collection, data aggregation, and data analytics.},

However, previous research has seldom focused on {CR} knowledge dissemination. Knowledge dissemination would be influenced by knowledge benefits, government incentives, dissemination costs, and social credit risk. To study the impact of these factors on {CR} knowledge dissemination, we built an evolutionary game model of {CR} knowledge dissemination based on complex networks. This model includes agents as network nodes with different degrees of credit knowledge and a willingness to share information. Through numerical simulations, this study examines the impact of these factors on {CR} knowledge dissemination, demonstrating that improving the public's learning abilities is a powerful and effective way to promote {CR} knowledge dissemination. Compared with other influencing factors, the promotional effect of learning ability was more prominent. To ensure public motivation for knowledge dissemination, dissemination costs must be maintained at low levels. Additionally, the risk to the social credit environment has a significant impact on the effectiveness of dissemination, and high credit environment risk can hinder the dissemination of credit knowledge. Particularly, a high-risk environment can easily lead to the failure of government incentives.},

To minimize political risk, when implementing it local ofﬁcials have selected easier goals from the “top-level design” blueprint. In City Z, for example, we ﬁnd that promoting integrity among businesses is less risky than promoting integrity among civil servants or the general public, so less progress has been made in the latter two areas when putting in place integrity credit-point systems. The risks involved in promoting social credit among the general populace are the greatest, so the city’s efforts in this have been limited. From our empirical study of China’s social credit system in City Z, we draw some conclusions about policy implementation under Xi Jinping.},

It argues that the construction of China’s credit system has the problems of insufficient rule of law, imperfect credit platform construction, and difficult credit repair.

            In recent years, credit reporting agencies are under pressure to reform themselves to reach higher levels of transparency. In this context, the critically considered digitally-implemented credit reporting system in China—the Chinese Social Credit System ({SCS})—is of particular interest. Compared to traditional credit reporting systems, the {SCS} has a wider range of goals, including enhancing social control, establishing a state-defined notion of trustworthiness and increasing market efficiency. It covers not only Chinese citizens, companies, and organizations but also foreign ones which have activities in or with China. This paper studies the transparency of the {SCS} from the perspective of foreign organizations. We conducted interviews with employees from German organizations that are engaged in commercial activities in or with China to understand how transparent the {SCS} is to them and to gather their perceptions about the role of the system in increasing the transparency of the Chinese business landscape. Our analysis of the interviews showcased an interesting contrast between reservations with respect to the system’s transparency and the belief that the {SCS} would enhance the transparency of the Chinese business landscape. Drawing on our analysis of the interviews, we discuss factors affecting {SCS} transparency and the role of the {SCS} in increasing corporate transparency. We further highlight that there are inherent limits when credit rating systems (such as the {SCS}) aim to provide transparency about market participants, while pursuing other objectives at the same time.},

We investigate how large, medium, small and micro Bavarian companies active in China are being classified and assessed under the {SCS}. This publicly accessible system aims to rank specific business activities either as desirable, rewarding them (through red lists), or as undesirable, punishing them (through administrative penalties or blacklists).

Our analysis of 170 Bavarian companies in China shows that these firms, for the most part, feature on red (positive) lists. However, almost 9\% of the companies are subject to negative entries in the system by way of an administrative penalty, which under certain circumstances may lead to inclusion on a blacklist. The positive entries relate mainly to tax matters, while contraventions to regulations in the areas of work safety, health and environment constitute the majority of negative entries. At regional level, though, there are significant differences regarding the implementation of the {SCS} by local authorities. We complement our analysis with findings from 10 in-depth interviews that provide insights into the experiences and perspectives of Bavarian companies based in China in the context of the {SCS}. Our evaluation feeds into recommendations for action, particularly regarding potential measures of support for Bavarian companies with Chinese subsidiaries.},

In this article, I argue that the grid system is an extension of existing governance structures. Facing conflicting central messaging, local grid development encountered isomorphic pressures, leading grids to resemble higherlevel administration and to inherit a top–down and stability-focused mode of operation. To support this argument, I analyse five aspects: shifts in elite-level discourse, the proliferation of the grid system, recruitment standards for grid members, grid members’ tasks, and their assessment. Showcasing wide local variety, the grid system retains a managerial approach while collapsing service provision into security.},

Our results illustrate that the {SCSs} are envisioned and designed as social quantification practices including two facets: a normative apparatus encouraging “good” citizens and social morality, and a regulative apparatus disciplining “deviant” behaviors and enforcing social management. We argue that the {SCSs} illustrate the significant shift in which state actors increasingly become data processors whereas citizens are reconfigured as datafied subjects that can be measured, compared, and governed. We suggest that the {SCSs} function as infrastructures of social quantification for enforcing social management, constructing differences, and nudging people towards desired behaviors defined by the state.},
